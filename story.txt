this is week 1 day 5 and we are doing a group git project. At this point in time, Alex is becoming a master of git. I hope we all can become masters of git.
This is act 2 for our journey, we are going to louisiana. Down to the swampy, stanky, south. I hope we have marshmallows.
we are close to missouri and we need more food. because i am very hungry!!!! Joshua and Brian decided we'll eat Alex first. Alex tastes like chicken.
